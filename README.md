Landing Page Project for The Odin Project

This is the landing page I built at the end of the HTML, CSS and Flexbox sections of The Odin Project.

I've found HTML and CSS fairly easy to pick up, though I can see there's much to learn, especially in writing cleaner, more easily read code. Flexbox was the biggest challenge, while conceptually I understood it very quickly, getting it working in practice was harder than I expected. Will have to keep practicing!
